### MeNu Guide Knowledge Graph (KG)

[MeNu Guide](https://github.com/LipiTUM/MeNuGUIDE) is a knowledge graph containing over 25 million triple statements on the relationships between foods, metabolites and diseases. It was created by combining the information from databases with the knowledge stored in ontologies. MeNu GUIDE is available in the turtle file format, which can easily be queried using SPARQL.

### Ultimate goal
Build a RAG on the relationships extracted from this KG as statements to help clinical nutritionists and scientists extract these relationships without having to code
